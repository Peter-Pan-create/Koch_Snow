# Koch_Snow
It is an easy implementation of Koch Snowflake using Python. The Koch snowflake (also known as the Koch curve, Koch star, or Koch island) is a mathematical curve and one of the earliest fractal curves to have been described. It is based on the Koch curve, which appeared in a 1904 paper titled “On a continuous curve without tangents, constructible from elementary geometry” by the Swedish mathematician Helge von Koch.  The progression for the area of the snowflake converges to 8/5 times the area of the original triangle, while the progression for the snowflake’s perimeter diverges to infinity. Consequently, the snowflake has a finite area bounded by an infinitely long line.
